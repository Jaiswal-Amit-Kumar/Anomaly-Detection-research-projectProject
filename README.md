# Deep Learning for Network Anomaly Detection


## Overview

This project explores the use of deep learning techniques for enhancing network anomaly detection in supervised datasets.  Traditional methods often struggle with novel or complex threats. This research proposes a novel framework that leverages deep learning to capture intricate patterns and relationships within network traffic data to identify anomalous behavior indicative of potential attacks. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of attack detection, leading to more robust and adaptive security systems.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing reliance on digital technologies makes networks and systems vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Anomaly detection is a crucial component of cybersecurity, but conventional approaches often struggle to identify sophisticated and evolving threats.  This project investigates the application of deep learning to improve attack detection models using supervised datasets, focusing on real-world data characteristics like imbalanced class representation and noise.  The aim is to develop a framework that can effectively identify anomalous behavior and enhance overall cybersecurity defenses.

## 2. Related Work

In the ever-evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity faces significant challenges due to the constant adaptation of cyber-attacks. Traditional cybersecurity measures often fall short in protecting against complex digital cyberattacks. Machine learning (ML) approaches, particularly anomaly detection techniques, have gained attention as valuable tools for strengthening cybersecurity defenses. However, the effectiveness of these techniques in real-world datasets can be compromised by factors such as imbalanced class representation, noise, and moving concepts.
This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging guided machine learning and deep learning to enhance attack discovery models in real-world datasets, as well as the development of a new approach.

## 3. Methodology

This project follows a structured methodology for identifying network attacks.  The key steps are:

*   **Data Acquisition and Preparation:** Collecting and preparing the network traffic data.
*   **Feature Selection:** Selecting the most relevant features for anomaly detection.
*   **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training and evaluating machine learning models to identify attacks.

### Data Acquisition & Preparation

1.  **Raw Data Acquisition:** Obtain raw network traffic data from sources like network connection logs and intrusion detection systems.  A well-designed supervised dataset with labeled instances (normal vs. malicious activity) is used.
2.  **Data Cleaning:**  Remove noise, handle missing values, and correct inconsistencies in the raw data to improve model performance.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Transform the data into a suitable format for deep learning algorithms:
    *   **Normalization:** Scale numerical features to a standard range to ensure equal contribution.
    *   **Encoding:** Convert categorical features into numerical values (e.g., using one-hot encoding).
    *   **Feature Engineering:** Create new, relevant features from existing data to enhance model performance.
4.  **Data Splitting:** Divide the preprocessed data into training, validation, and testing sets:
    *   **Training Set:** Used to train the deep learning models.
    *   **Validation Set:** Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
    *   **Testing Set:** Used to evaluate the final model's performance.

### Feature Selection

1.  **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality by identifying the principal components (features) that explain most of the variance in the data.
2.  **Scree Plot:** Use a scree plot to visualize the variance explained by each principal component, helping to determine the optimal number of components to retain.

### Model Training & Evaluation

1.  **Model Training:** Train the specified machine learning models using the training data.
2.  **Model Comparison:** Train and test multiple models to identify the most effective one.
3.  **Cross-Validation:** Perform cross-validation on the best-performing model to ensure its generalizability to unseen data.
4.  **Prediction:** Use the best-performing model to make predictions on unseen data.

## 4. Implemented Models

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

*   **Decision Tree Classifier:** A non-parametric model that partitions the feature space based on decision rules.
*   **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
*   **GaussianNB Classifier:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence.
*   **LGBM Classifier:** (LightGBM) A gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and accuracy.
*   **CatBoost Classifier:** A gradient boosting algorithm that excels at handling categorical features.

## 5. Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains network traffic data with labeled instances of normal and malicious activities. It consists of 84 columns and 555278 rows, including a timestamp indicating the recording time of the data.

*   **Description:** The dataset provides a multifaceted insight into various metrics such as flow duration, packet counts, and window sizes.
*   **Features:** The columns offer a wide array of network traffic measurements encompassing packet exchanges, data packet dimensions, and flow durations.
*   **Statistical Measures:** Each column includes statistical measurements such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum.
*   **Missing Values:** The dataset does not appear to have any missing or null values, as each column has all of the statistical measures.
